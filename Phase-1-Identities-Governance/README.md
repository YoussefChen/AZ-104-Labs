# Phase 1 – Manage Azure Identities and Governance

## About This Chapter

This chapter is part of my personal hands-on AZ-104 project. I’m transitioning into cloud and cybersecurity from a non-IT background, and this phase helped me build real-world skills in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), access management, and governance.

Each lab here is designed to go beyond just passing the exam they helped me understand how identity and access are handled in real Azure environments. All labs were done using the Azure and Entra Portals, with clean screenshots, detailed steps, and proper cleanup.

## What I Practiced

In this phase, I focused on learning how to:

- Create and manage **users**, **groups**, and **nested groups**
- Use **custom directory roles** and assign **built-in roles**
- Apply **Azure role-based access control (RBAC)** to resources
- Work with **Administrative Units** to delegate control
- Understand the difference between **Azure roles vs Microsoft Entra roles**
- Monitor access using **audit logs** and **sign-in logs**
- Use **Access Reviews** to keep permissions under control
- Manage **role assignments** at different scopes
- Apply **group-based access control** for cleaner permission management

## Why It Matters (To Me and to Recruiters)

These are the identity and governance tools used by real companies to manage access securely in Microsoft cloud environments. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just clicking through tutorials — each lab was built with:

- Clear, real-world scenarios
- Azure Portal-only navigation (step-by-step)
- Cleanup instructions to avoid resource waste
- Professional GitHub structure and documentation

Each folder contains:
- A detailed `README.md` with learning steps
- Screenshots of the full process
- Notes for clean-up and GitHub presentation

## My Goal

I'm building this public lab portfolio to:

- Prove my hands-on Azure experience to recruiters
- Show how seriously I’m learning cloud security
- Document my progress toward the **AZ-104**, **PowerShell**, and **AZ-500** certifications

Even though I didn’t come from a traditional IT background, this project shows that I’m willing to put in the work and learn things the right way.
