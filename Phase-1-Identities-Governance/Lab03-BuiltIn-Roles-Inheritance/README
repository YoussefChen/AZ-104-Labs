# Lab 3 – Built-in Roles, Role Inheritance, and Deny Assignments

## Objective
Understand role inheritance across Azure scopes, and how to override access using deny assignments.

---

## What Was Done

- Created RG: `rg-rbac-inheritance`
- Assigned built-in Reader role at subscription level to `susan.sales`
- Created a Storage Account inside RG
- Observed full access inherited across scopes
- Assigned a **deny policy** using Azure Policy
- Verified deny behavior against inherited role

## Security Insight

Built-in roles are **broad** and often overused.  
This lab shows:
- Role inheritance is automatic unless scoped properly
- Deny assignments **override RBAC**  essential for high-security governance
- Best practice: **assign at lowest scope possible**, use deny policies to restrict abuse

---

## Clean-up Instructions

- Remove Reader role from subscription
- Delete deny policy
- Delete `rg-rbac-inheritance`
