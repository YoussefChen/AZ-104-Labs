# Lab 06: Advanced Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

## Overview

This lab demonstrates advanced configurations of Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for secure, time-bound, and scoped access to Azure Storage resources. It covers Service SAS, User Delegation SAS, IP restrictions, and Stored Access Policies, all of which are crucial when designing secure file-sharing or access automation scenarios in enterprise environments.

## Objectives

- Generate and use Service SAS with scoped permissions and expiry
- Create and test User Delegation SAS based on Azure AD
- Implement Stored Access Policies for centralized SAS control
- Apply IP-based access restrictions to limit exposure
- Simulate real-world secure file sharing use cases

## Tools & Services

- Azure Portal
- Azure Storage Accounts
- Azure Blob Containers
- Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
- Stored Access Policies

## Real-World Relevance

Understanding and controlling SAS is essential when working with partners, temporary contractors, or automation processes. As a consultant, configuring SAS correctly ensures both secure and compliant access to sensitive data while avoiding misconfigurations that lead to data leaks or unnecessary exposure.
