# Lab 08 - Immutable Blob Storage & Legal Holds

This lab focuses on securing blob data using Azure's immutable storage capabilities. It demonstrates how to enforce regulatory compliance and audit-readiness by applying time-based retention policies and legal holds via the Azure Portal.

##  Objectives
- Enable version-level immutability on containers
- Apply a time-based retention policy (WORM)
- Lock the immutability policy
- Apply a legal hold tag
- Test protection against deletion

##  Azure Services Used
- Azure Storage Account (General Purpose v2)
- Blob Containers
- Immutable Blob Storage (Time-based & Legal Hold policies)
