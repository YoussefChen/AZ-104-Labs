# Lab 1 ‚Äì Secure General Purpose v2 (GPv2) Storage Account

## Objective
Deploy a secure and enterprise-compliant GPv2 Azure Storage Account using hardened configurations aligned with Zero Trust principles and storage governance best practices.

---

## What Was Done

### üîπ Storage Configuration
- Created a General Purpose v2 (GPv2) Storage Account
- Configured region as North Europe and set redundancy to Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- Enforced secure transfer and set minimum TLS version to 1.2
- Disabled all forms of public access and anonymous blob access

### üîπ Governance & Protection
- Applied resource tags for `Owner`, `Environment`, and `Department`
- Enabled soft delete for blobs and containers with 7-day retention
- Added a resource lock to prevent accidental deletion

### üîπ Networking & Encryption
- Limited access to selected networks (whitelisted client IP only)
- Ensured encryption with Microsoft-managed keys (default)

## Security Insight
This lab demonstrates how to deploy storage using a hardened-by-default approach. By combining secure network access, TLS-only enforcement, encryption, and immutability features like locks and soft delete, the configuration reflects enterprise-level compliance and reduces the risk of data exfiltration or misconfiguration.

## Clean-up Instructions
- Delete the resource group `RG-Storage-Secured` to clean up all resources created in this lab.

‚û°Ô∏è **Next lab**:  
[Lab 2 ‚Äì Shared Access Signatures & Stored Access Policies](../Lab02-SAS-StoredAccessPolicy/README.md)

This lab laid the security groundwork that will support more granular data access control via SAS and stored access policies in the next lab.
